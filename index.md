# Data Description
My research content is to use computer simulation software to make the mechanical parts meet the movement trajectory required by the movement. It only works on software. In this study, due to the needs of the design that I needed a specific 4-bar rod trajectory to complete the design. Therefore, I will use data experiments to explore the fitting degree of the motion trajectory generated by the data set of the motion coordinates and motion positions of the 4-bar rod and the rod motion trajectory required by the experimental results.
